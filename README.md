# Bank_Loan_Eligibility_Prediction
  The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a
loan applicant will be eligible for a loan. The model will be trained on a dataset of
historical loan applications, and it will use the data to learn the factors that are most
predictive of loan eligibility.

● Clean the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies.
Perform data normalisation or scaling as required. Split the dataset into training
and testing sets, ensuring an appropriate distribution of loan approval classes.

● There are a variety of machine learning models that can be used for loan
eligibility prediction. Some of the most common models include logistic
regression, decision trees, and random forests. The best model for this project
will depend on the specific features of the dataset.

● This project has the potential to make a significant impact on the lending
industry. By accurately predicting loan eligibility, banks can make more
informed lending decisions and reduce their risk of default.
